 ,December, Had a four hour break from the office today. We had to get out because they were painting the th floor and all the fumes got in the vents. Like all other Pinoys , we went to the mall. hahahahaha Thought about watching Mano Po and struggle with Kris Aquino's one facial expression. No matter how much she screws up her face, there's just one expression there . But thought better of it and saw Dekada ' . That was screwy I began to hate the Marcoses all over again....... The image that keeps replaying itself over and over again in my head is Jhong Hilario's torture scene.....I want my mommy..... ,December, This is it. Finally got myself some space in this cyber reality. Got myself a virtual diary. Oh come on, don't be so dismissive. This is what these things are. If I know, kayo din naghahanap ng lakas ng loob para gumawa ng ganito. Tama na yang kaartehan nyo . If you, like, think that I'm seeeew pathetic that I, like, have to broadcast my emotions to the madla , do me a favor. Go offline. Find a book and make yourself more literate. The earth will thank you, and who knows You could pass yourself off as something more than a half wit. Where was I Oh yes, my virtual diary. I spend more than hours online and I figure that this is much safer way of venting. Better a program than my boss. Less chance of getting fired. I need the money. Those shoes don't geow on trees, you know. They don't come cheap. Note to self: remember to write down forays into shoe retail.... I promise to TRY to not be too melodramatic.

He sent back something which basically said thet he didn't believe I felt that way. Ouch. I don't much believe in happily ever after, especially for me. There is no such thing. And I never believed that there was one special person out there for me; neither did I put much trust in my relatives' belief that I would get marrried. Never. But with Jon, it was different. I would have walked the ends of the earth for this guy. I would have turned my back on everything that was home and gone with him. He only had to ask. That was the only thing he had to do. I would have sacrificed everything. EVERYTHING It's all over now. I haven't heard from him in weeks and now, my heart is broken. Where I never believed I was capable of suffering for someone else's happiness, now I do. I loved fully, and honestly, and truthfully when I fell in love with Jonathan David Oldhouser. And he didn't love me back. Never again. I will never, never love again. Shop's closed. Love don't live here anymore. ,January, Shop's closed. Love don't live here anymore. ,January, Here we are again, fast approaching the most man made of holidays is it even that Valentine's. I remember being alone for most of the February s in my lifetime, but I cannot remember being this sad. I cannot think of how I'll be on that day.... I've been with Jonathan for almost years and while we've gone through spells of not talking to one another, it has never lasted this long. And I've always had e mail....Why do guys do this He has told me he loves me. And I do know him well enough to know that he means it. Then how come I practically have to beg for his attention I'm standing on the verge of just ringing him up to hear his voice. Am I so insignificant to him that he thinks nothing of ignoring me ,January, Just got hold of a book by Randolf S. David Prof. Randy David, to us inhabitanats of the P.I. . I forgot what is was called, but it was a collection of the articles he had written for the Philippine Daily Inquirer . Everything was good. They were all cleverly written and I felt as if the good professor were reading the entries to me as I read them. For one who is extremely passionate about what he teaches and his convictions for the motherland, Prof. David is a very soft spoken man. Very malumanay..... I, on the other hand, belong to the school of thought that believes that passion is best expressed with noise. Plus, my statements are often punctuated with gesticulations that, if done by someone lighter, would cause that individual to take flight. As Jessica Zafra said: If you can't dazzle them with artistry, drown them with noise....... You should all get a copy of Professor David's book....It's available at the Sociology Department of the University of the Philippines. Pesos, I think.... ,March, My Soulmate says that this guy Gael Garcia Bernal is the male species' equivalent of Gardenia Bread . Masarap kahit walang palaman. I wouldn't know.

thursdayschildtoo: you know what i mean fairytales : even though it is set up for that ever important st time i think that if you allow yourself to feel again and take that risk that it will happen. i know that the st time moment has really been built up, so try to releaze that that is not the end all, be all , but u r an intelligent and awesome person, so life will totally work out for u thursdayschildtoo: nope. it took me this long to finally fall in love. i hate that i was taken for granted when i put in every effort. thursdayschildtoo: the fall out is too horrible. thursdayschildtoo: and that's easy for you to say erik you've never been ugly fairytales : i can definitely feel u on that, but realize that there r billion people out there and along the way u run into jerks and people that don't appreciate who u r and what u do. it's a learning process and u have to keep going and learn from everything. it's ok to take the time to learn about someone and keep the guard up for that, but don't let yourself be so hurt or get so jaded that u never let yourself take that chance again thursdayschildtoo: how do you know who is or isn't the jerk fairytales : ok, i've definitely felt ugly for many moments in my life and i know what u look like, so don't even say that u r ugly. i think that the little things in life count and someone that is able to recognize and sincerely appreciate those things is someone that isn't a jerk. i think that in that instance it is clear to see if one is being fake about that thursdayschildtoo: not really....sometimes the level of like lust is too high to judge clearly fairytales : i see that point, but i think that through time and events that u go through, it becomes more apparent even with those goggles on and u see the true content of character and personality cuz evn the best of con artists can't maintain fakeness: through out the course of time thursdayschildtoo: i hope so...for your sake at least fairytales : yours too, u better not shut down that great heart of yours thursdayschildtoo: you deserve perfection fairytales : before i can be worthy of derserving anything, i need to be able to be satisfied with me and who i am thursdayschildtoo: good point thursdayschildtoo: although self worth is indirectly determined by other's perception of you fairytales : indirectly...but a significant other should be the compliment of an already complete person thursdayschildtoo: good point. although useless info to me fairytales : so, that fundamental sense of self worth should already be in place fairytales : give yourself more credit pia...u r a cute girl with great intelligence, personality and an awesome heart thursdayschildtoo: yup...that's me: the cute girl full of personality fairytales : don't give me that sarcastic shit thursdayschildtoo: and don't yell at me fairytales : do u know how much props u need ot give yourself for being able to communicate so clearly with me while living in a foreign country that speaks such a foreign language fairytales : i wasn't yelling..just emphasizing fairytales : that is a hard thing to do thursdayschildtoo: it comes from watching years of sesame street. fairytales : ha :p fairytales : what r u thinking thursdayschildtoo: reading my blog thursdayschildtoo: sesame street should win a nobel prize for something fairytales : yea, i agree...what is a blog thursdayschildtoo: online journal fairytales : am i in it : thursdayschildtoo: i'm probably gonna put this up there later thursdayschildtoo: i'm saving this conversation fairytales : ok, cool thursdayschildtoo: do you mind fairytales : well, i have to unfortunately say that i must go, but please realize that u r a great human and i am very happy that i know u and look very forward to the day that i get to meet u in person and give u a great big hug... no, i don't mind thursdayschildtoo: thanks erik....i'll see you online soon thursdayschildtoo: thankyou fairytales : my address is .....erik collins U WISH I'D POST THIS, DON'T YOU so mail me a letter and pix and i wil wirte u back, ok thursdayschildtoo: Pia Garcia DREAM ON fairytales : good night day : thursdayschildtoo: you too, friend thursdayschildtoo: be safe..... thursdayschildtoo: break a leg Thanks, Erik. ,March, Horoscopes are crap and this proves it. This was in the urlLink Manila Standard yesterday: Libra: You long to renew a relationship but view responsibilities with caution. This state of affairs tends to sabotage your love life. Give romance another chance. Aquarius plays a part. Bullshit. I'm at work, blogging when I should be working again . I'm not really sure if I even qualify as someone who has a horoscope since I was born on the cusp. But I laways read mine because it never matches the crap that's going on in my life anyway, but that one yesterday just made me suck in my breath. I wonder if he even thinks of me because that's all I do at night think of him. I've given up hoping. Basta , all I know is that there is no space left for me in his life. And that is what will kill me.... Ended up texting all night with my BFF, Roxanne WTF, I'm twenty freakin' five and I still use that acronym because her mom is Satan's successor. I hate her her mom . Roxy's freakin' amazing and she doesn't deserve that harpy. I hope Roxy gets to be dirty, rotten, filthy, stinkin' rich and her mom swallows her tongue. I hate feeling envious by the way. I hate the feeling inspred by that most famous of all muses the green eyed monster. I dreamt about Tricia's hunny. We were sitting next to each other and we were talking. I was speaking in taglish , but I think he understood me. He showed me his wallet and I opened it and saw that it was full of photos of fans in my dream I found it strange that it was full of photos of people from my high school.

From her March entry: I keep dreaming of you and things are the way they are now: I'm engaged to someone else, you've been out of touch for so long. We see each other I think I've flown all the way there to see you only I cannot remember getting on off a plane but there we are, and I pretend that it's all good, that I still don't get that sharp pain sometimes when I think of us, and you're being good, not just good, great: charming, sweet all the things I loved you for. And I ask you those questions I've been wanting to for, ooh, years now and you tell me truthfully that you were scared. We laugh and are so easy together. Your hair is longer and darker, curly even, you let the streaks of blonde grow out. I run my fingers through it playfully and it feels just the way it used to, thick and silky. You take my hand in yours and see my ring and then it hits me: we can't just run away and pretend it was all a bad dream. I have someone else now, someone not afraid to love me and make sacrifices for me. I tell you how good he is to me and you smile sadly, you know you missed your chance. I tell you you could have called me, could have let me know you were still mine all this time, but you tell me I should have known . It hurts less now to think of you, less than last year, or the one before . Less than that last night we spent together where I felt I was tearing in two. Where we sat in our apartment and smoked and watched the snow outside swirl around the streetlight. I wished time would stand still, swore I would not sleep, but in the end I was exhausted from crying all week, and there was to be no last minute reprieve. You held it together so well you'd only ever cried that once, three months earlier, when I was trying to decide whether to go home then or stay for New Year's, the millennium and I asked you what you wanted and you said me. We slept badly that last night, I kept waking up to see the time. Finally we awoke at and you were doing a great job of keeping me preoccupied until you found the card I had made for you and you collapsed on our bed, sobbing, clutching my t shirt. We drove to the airport in swirling snow and I hoped for a moment that my plane would be grounded, but then it was only prolonging the pain. You watched me smoke my last cigarette outside the airport and snowflakes landed on my lashes and froze with my tears. You said we'd be together again but somewhere deep down I knew it was over... ,March, tricia : whachup thursdayschildtoo: wala.... there was a pause thursdayschildtoo: sorry ha..nagchichismisan kami

I'm through with being hopeful. No point in getting all worked up over something useless, right I just got out of a really harrowing relationship. And the word relationship in this case is very loosely I treated it seriously and he didn't. I think the word love was even used a few times, but it was always initiated by yours truly. I should've taken the hint from there and just run in the opposite direction, but I didn't. See, when you're blinded by overwhelming infatuation you really can't think straight. You're so blinded about the prospect of what could be with the other person that you think the world is a shiny, happy place. Then of course some redneck had the audacity to declare war. sheesh. I keep thinking, at what point does the world recognize that only people who are beautiful have the right to fall in love and have their happily ever afters I've been ensnared in this mortal coil for years and have yet to find someone who will walk the ends of the earth for me. I would love to be part of that entire scene. Don't get me wrong, I still don't buy the you're other half is out there bullshit. Because think of it this way, what happens if you don't find each other Regardless of your efforts to find him her of course. Because let's face it, you have to work hard for something that's gonig to be worth keeping, right If you don't find The One , what happens then Do you live half a life Do you love people by halves And what about the empty half of you Does it wither and die Someone who's in the know, please explain it to me. mood sleepy as hell mental turntable Walkin' On Broken Glass by Annie Lennox ,March, This song is repeating itself over and over and over in my head.

How long has Dawson's Creek been running years Then why the HELL do Joey and Dawson keep running after each other at train stations and or bridges and or airports just to say don't go Nyeeeeeta naman o. Even the local teen dramas in the PI are better than that. At least here, someone gets plotted against by the other girl who has a crush on the boyfriend of the terminally nice heroine, who ends up being kidnapped and then rescued by the crush boy only that the CB gets shot by the kidnapper who actually has a crush on the TNH but only kidnapped TNH because the OT brainwashed him. Tapos now, TNH and CB are supposed to get married but TNH is having second thoughts after seasons because she was played false before. YAN ang plot YAN ang drama Suspension of disbelief talaga Dawson's Creek has nothing on the scriptwriting skills of the people behind Tabing Ilog. I don't watch TI. I only see it on the afternoons where I'm in the office and we're having merienda in the cafeteria. In between bites I ask Meryl, Sino si Anong nangyari sa kanya Bakit sha aalis O.

After Joey ran to Dawson the second time, I was tempted to sue. They should just change the theme of the entire thing and just name it Pacey . He has the most personality anyway. Dawson looks like Glenn Close. I love tagalog. Nothing beats the language when it comes to insulting things. Another thing, coming down from valium is not fun.

I promised Agnes I'd post the entire thing, but it was too long. Here are the parts which I relate to the most. Comments and violent reactions are most welcome. ...marriage has never been one of my goals. Sure, it could be nice to maybe get into that someday, but it's not like I'm going to kill myself if I don't get hitched...I really just can't imagine myself with anyone, much less visualize the kind of love that never runs out of things to say. Try as I might, I cannot surmise how one can find a person that he or she would be able to live with from youth till old age , and be able to love intensely day in and day out, over and above blood relations...marriage to me, at the moment, is defintely something I don't need to be happy. It's a nice dream, but like any pleasant dream, it requires too much thought, decision, complexity, and perfect characters than I can find or handle right now. ...Behind the shadows, I find some unrealistic yet comforting solace in the supposed existence of one who will be able to read past the jargon, as others call my words, and know exactly what I am saying. Idealistic fool that I am, I reserve the heart for the one who will sacrifice even a part of himself to find it. ...It hurts to feel inadequate and unworthy of someone with all the right qualities, and I don't pretend not to cry at nights knowing that the permanence of loneliness in my life is a big possibility. But the philosophy that has kept my sanity in check is that there is no point in being miserable about something that is not tangible in my life just yet...I see nothing much that can be done when you don't even see what you want. If there's another thing I've learned, it's never to settle for anything less than what I need. The sad thing about life is that dreams are usually so cookie cutter perfect, that people just settle for the closest things to them. They don't believe in the existence and sheer possibilities of their own desires. Like me, they're probably afraid to...But what does prepare a person for love and desire, pain and loss Each of un runs from even the things we want, primarily because we are afraid to claim them as ours, of consequently being incapable of keeping them, and of realizing that we are inadequate for their needs and wants. in my head ...totoo ba yan... in my ears Just Wave Hello by Charlotte Church ,April, I was reading the urlLink Manila Standard yesterday evening and came across Karenina Yaptinchay's column, Singles. The first few paragraphs of urlLink yesterday's column hit like the proverbial ton of bricks between the eyes. The problem with trying to find happiness as a single person is that you would find yourself being pulled by two opposite forces. One force makes you hope that one day, you would find the person you would love for the rest of your life. The other tells you to get real and live with the statistical fact that there is a possibility, the remoteness of which depends on circumstances surrounding you, of a whole life of singlehood. Both forces are pulling so hard they can actually tear into a million pieces. They each represent distinct possibilities we all must learn to live with. I came a cross a similar essay written by a student from DLSU for their annual literary portfolio Runaway it was called through my sister who gave me the book and told me, Ate , read this. She could be you. I did, and I remember being so struck by it that after reading the essay I couldn't even react to what was written down. How can someone, in a few paragraphs, capture all the knotted feelings you've been harboring It felt good to finally have someone feel the same way you do. My sister was right, she and I could have been the same person. in my head he'd better like it in my ears Thank You by Dido ,April, I will not be convient for you. I will not stand by and wait for you while you do all the little things you do. in my head should i stay or should i go in my ears Answer The Phone by Sugar Ray ,April, Saw urlLink Margo's blog while surfing along the waves dotting urlLink Blogger , and there was something about her sporting a purse made out of recycled Plus Orange Juice packs. I always wanted one of their purses but never knew where to get one. Now I'm even more convinced that it's fun. You should check out the portfolio link of her page....she does great work. in my head Regine Velasquez has some set of lungs on her, don't she in my ears Tuwing Umuulan by Regine V. ,April, I was running across my list of linked blogs today and looking through their comments page and then I saw urlLink Steve's blog through urlLink Sarah's are you following me . Damn if this guy doesn't own the funniest and most interesting blog I've ever come across. Read his entry titled Ten Things I Hate About Julia Stiles and see if it doesn't make you laugh. There was also this bit about him meeting up with an ex after three years. I'm the last person in the world to be talking about love right about now, but it's heartening to see that guys feel the same about past relationships as girls do. Well, him at least. And another guy who will remain nameless for now. And to put that out into the world it's like hanging up your soul on a clothesline and waiting for public ridicule to come along. I wanted to comment but I chickened out. OK, so I'm listening to urlLink SS for the bazillionth time. I can't help it. All the admittedly, overplayed songs still ellicit the same feelings. Ok, so I was part of the tropical cyclone that was here earlier this month and which followed them around, and I'm not ashamed of that. If I were a fan of someone who was talented but ill mannered read: Jewel , I'd be mortified, but they were nice guys. I don't know why I'm even justifying this. I know of someone who could listen to All I Have all day long. Don't even get me started on Jennifer Lopez.... I spent last night crying while texting BFF and urlLink Tricia . I could go on and on about what was sent through SMS, but as the fear of being overly lachrymose threatens again, I will just say that it was about broken promises. I can almost hear I Can't Make You Love Me being played in the background. Nina's video was just played on the channel. When I first heard this song, I thought the title was Palakang Baliw . I went: What the hell That's a horrible title Then I heard it again and went: Aaaah. Para Kang Baliw . and believed that it was what it was called. Just a few days ago, urlLink Heidi told me that it was actually Second Floor . What do I care I read my boss' blog today and saw that he still addresses me by my handle. Funny. It took several months before he actually knew my name. As there are too many thoughts inside my head, I will stop now. See you all tomorrow. If I don't cry myself into dehydration tonight. in my head oh, help.... in my ears Toe The Line by Stephen Speaks ,April, I got home before pm for the first time weeks last night wanting to watch Josie and the Pussycats on Star World . I got home and began reading the paper to kill time before the movie started, when the I saw the ad for my Joshie's televised concert performance. One sentence came to mind: Oh, my God How could I have completely forgotten about it But I really wanted to watch Rachel Leigh Cook flaunt her cat ears so I watched the movie on Star World and switched the channel to as soon as it ended I'm still singing when you're happy and you know it... in my head as I write this . Good thing too, because as soon as I did Ethel began the text barrage on my Joshie. It went this way: Ethel: Nakaktunaw talga boses nya Pai. Me: I know. Hindi na sha mukhang kawawa dito. He looks so sexy here. E: I agree. Joshie sings swoon . And after some time Joshie introduces the musicians... Me: The bald guy is cute. noticing that he changed into a black sweater vest with a white shirt underneath eeep Mukha shang waiter. E: True. I liked the black shirt better. Me: I liked the burgundy wine colored one. And for the record, I would not trade in his curls for the most gorgeous bald guy in the world. Joshie sings again I begin crying just aboout now Me: OMG, Eth Don't tell me he already sang To Where You Are E: Yep. Nung umpisa. Me: OMG, even Alejate E: Yep. You didn't see it Me: Nooooo I was watching Josie and the Pussycats. Now I'm really gonna have to buy the CD VCD package... E: Dang I wanted to watch that too Me: Don't worry, they'll be showing it again tomorrow at : pm notices a violin playing lady gryrating on a platform behind my Joshie WHO IS THAT MALANDING BABAE E: Oooh, white shirt again.... Me: Lili Haydn pala ha Another person to add to my to kill list... E: Pai, nakakatakot ka In fairness, she plays the violin well... Me: Oweno ngayon Can she play the sax For the record I can't play the sax either, but it just felt like it would be a good comeback. Andrea Corr begins singing with my Joshie... E: O, kaya mo yan Andrea Corr... Me: Yan E hindi naman maganda yung babaeng yan e. Magaling lang yung make up artist nya . E: You saw her na Me: No. But someone I know interviewed her and I asked if all of the girls in the band were as pretty in person and he said: Make up is a wonderful thing . Tee hee. Joshie sings The Prayer with Angie Stone. Ethel notices the intro Joshie gave. E: A big...............HEART. hehehehe..... Me: Lintek Kung yan lang pala ang hanap ng lalakeng yan, andito naman ako a Pero, in fairness, magaling si Ms. Stone. E: You've heard her other songs Me: Yep. I have a friend who's a big fan. E: Makapag download nga. Me: You do know that this convo is going to end up on my blog, don't you BOTH OF THEM.... E: Then it's a good thing I edited when I did. Me: hehehe. I would have censored it. Then the concert ends.... E: Tapos na Now I'm really gonna have to buy this package... Me: Yep. The concert's finished. After some more texting.... E: Ok, good night now. I'll see you online tomorrow. Me: Sure thing. I'm gonna enjoy my Joshie now.... E: Say goodnight for me. Kiss him goodnight for me. ; Me: Over na yung kiss, wag na yun.... And then I get a text from Roxanne: BFF: OMG I completely forgot about Joshie's concert And then of course we started all over again.... in my head ...when you're happy and you know it, clap your hands... in my ears Pretend To Be Nice by Josie and the Pussycats ,April, .

In the spirit of bacchanalian delights, let's run down the list of hedonistic pleasures I've participated in the past few years. Nicotine: years, then I quit cold turkey not even tempted now. Alcohol: still do sometimes. I just don't like that my mouth tastes like a sewer afterwards. Weed: a looooong time ago. Screwed with my braincells so that ended as quickly as it began.

They looked like they were and still had the boyband thing going on.

I'm not really comfortable about putting the entire issue here because it involves a group of people that certain individuals in my circle feel strongly about. And as members of my circle read this blog, I'd rather not cause friction as of yet. Dadating din tayo jan. But really, in retrospect, what they did was unnerving. And although I think nothing of it and it seriously doesn't affect how I feel about what they put out, it places huge doubts as to how sincere they really are. Something's rotten in the state of Denmark..... Seriously thinking of quitting this job. I love it and it gives me wonderful perks, but to paraphrase someone self fulfillment crap aside, I need to earn a living. I need to put this down before I forget again: The greatest challenge of friendship, to me at least, has always been faith. Not faith in your friends in which case is always a given; you always hold your friends in esteem but rather faith in yourself. You consider yourself capable of moving mountains for people you call friends. I don't know if I've moved or nudged any mountains or molehills for my friends, but they've always pushed the greatest geological protrusions out of the way for me.

They're contestants in this season's urlLink Amazing Race the one reality show that's still alive which I still like. I don't care about what you're going to say about urlLink Joe Millionaire , urlLink The Bachelor and urlLink The Bachelorette . I don't care. They should've named those shows Who Wants to Show The World That They Have No Pride As for urlLink Survivor , it ended after urlLink Ethan won. Marquesas was such a waste of airtime. Anyway, back to Reichen and Chip. They're gorgeous. They're educated. They're smart. They're gay. That really wouldn't be much of a problem because that's never stopped me before. But the clincher They're married. To each other. While I am single, available, willing, employed AND heterosexual, I can't even get a guy. The universe is conspiring against me. in my head wahwahwah.... in my ears Lady Marmalade by Li'l Kim, Christina Aguilera, Pink and Mya gay anthem bweset ,May, I love Roxy because: I was the first one she called after she found out she got that jaw dropping NMAT score. she calls Jork just to tell me he sounds like Chewbacca first thing in the morning. she has never told me that my ideas were stupid and worthless, even when I know that they are. she's always on my side. she makes her brother play You're Still You on the piano and calls me up to make me listen to him play it, because she knows I love the song. when she was studying for the NMAT, she didn't mind that I'd call her in the middle of the night to talk about nothing. Everyone should have a best friend like her one who won't mind that your stupid ideas are likely murderous, and who'll put down reviewers for biochemistry because you're on the phone and want to talk about nothing. And I love my brother because he tried to fix the straps of my flipflops when they broke in the supermarket yesterday. And when they saw that they were beyond mending, he took off his sneakers for me to wear and went off IN HIS SOCKS to get me a new pair of flipflops so I wouldn't look funny. in my head life is good. you should get one. in my ears So Help Me Girl by Gary Barlow ,May, Wishing on Another Lucky Star J.D. Souther Your friends may lie The truth can come from strangers If I knew why, We wouldn't be in this danger Leaning out the window of my car And wishing on another lucky star. Life is long It is not made to measure You will go on The same in pain and pleasure Wondering how we ever got this far... By wishing on another lucky star. Life goes on As sure as the sky It's come and gone In the wink of an eye You leave your home On the wings of a lie: You will never die. The world is cold The heart gets torn and tattered The one you hold It can be dropped and shattered Leaning out the window of my car And wishing on another lucky star. Because the song is so beautiful, and the urlLink movie where it was taken from was so beautiful and just held me in awe on so many levels.

I need to get this out of my system. The summer sun has come to stay, Bikinis, tans, outrageous legs, They're all retarded and they all look the same, And barbie's body is melting down, On her face a big fat frown, 'cause Mr. Cellulite just moved into town. Well me and B we hate supermodels, It's not that we know anyone personally, It's just that I'm tired of being compared. The boys they come here, With expectations for the summer, And I refuse to take any part of this barbaric ritual, 'cause God has given me a mind, That I will use from time to time, And I got more on my head, Than what's made by Paul Mitchell. Was it worth the tears you cried... to fit the size Think it over once or twice, What lasts the longest in this life, Character, or rock hard thighs And in the end do you believe, That beauty lies in what you see 'cause if you do, then baby You ve been deceived. Supermodels Kendall Payne ,May, I finally bought something off an auction site. A couple of weeks ago, I had posted something about wanting a copy of urlLink Revenge of the Baby Sat . urlLink Cha posted and suggested that I try urlLink Avalon to look for a marked down copy. I went and found that the book had already been bought, but saw that someone was selling a copy of a book I have had trouble finding forever: The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy. I knew that a new copy is going for around P , so finding a copy in very good condition for P was a deal. Anyway, I got my book today and I am sooo happy. It's in excellent condition and Jasper the guy who sold me the book was an extremely nice guy. If you ever have books you want to sell or are looking for good bargains on second hand stuff, go to urlLink www.avalon.ph . It's totally worth it.

Thank you. in my head thank you, Cha in my ears I Fall So Deep by Gary Barlow ,May, I've received e mails from non Pinoy folk who read my blog and ask who Jessica Zafra is. I told them that she's a Filipino writer. And they ask for where they can find her work. I tell them to go to urlLink google and ask, because google knows everything. They're tamad , so for their benefit and for my sanity, may I redirect you to urlLink here . It's not the official site, I think that was taken down already. But there are samples of her work there. I especially like urlLink The Daze of Whine and Neuroses . Oh and I came across urlLink Jay's blog quite by accident. His blog is called kwentong tambay and as soon as I can find my brain, I'm going to translate that into english. It's fun; he's a good writer and his entires make me want to write entries only in tagalog. Pero nakakatakot ako magsulat sa tagalog e. Baka ikahiya pa ako ng tatay ko. Jay's a Filipino living in Singapore and can relate to most of what he says. Especially the stories about the train experices in the morning and the missing R . Does this mean I want to go back and live in Singapore Hell no. ,May, I had a three hour lunch with tita Cecile and Monique yesterday at Cravings in Katipunan and felt very continental. I always thought that extremely long lunches were only for the French and Spanish and then I had one yesterday and just felt glorious. The food was excellent Cravings had a sun dried tomato basil onion garlic olive oil spread that was just heavenly , the company was perfect, the conversation was heavenly and the air conditioning was bliss. I've heard people say that the ultimate perfect experience was a day of pampering at the spa, but I beg to differ. Spend a loooong lunch with people who just float your boat and feel all the tension and worries melt away. After that lunch, it was off to the mall because my tita had errands to run. I ended up at the unmentionables section of SM and picked out a load of new knickers. I told urlLink Tricia how many pairs I bought and she couldn't believe it. Neither can I actually, but ladies, agree with me when I say that part of the fun of being female is that our undergarments are much, MUCH more interesting than those of the male species. The day was topped off perfectly by the moon last night. Did anyone notice it The moon was unusually bright last night. Midnight looked like it was nearer to daybreak. I had an espcially good view, because at this time of the year, the moon drapes herself directly over my bedroom window. If I were still practicing, I would say that last night would have been the perfect night to cast a love spell. Then today I saw photos of crush boy on his website. I'm not telling who he is or what the url is. I'm keeping him secret for now. Tad say's he's funny. Yes he is. He's funny and smart and has beautiful hands. To paraphrase Bridget Jones, ...He's perfect . I am blissful, can you tell Although Tad did mention that he wasn't gorgeous actually, what Tad really said was, You're not into pretty boys, are you No I'm not, but crush boy is more than just being pretty. He's absolutely IDEAL. I am so, SO happy. Tonight I could crash and burn, but I don't care right now. I wish all of you have a day like this. in my head sigh in my ears Days by Craig David ,May, Hooray for my urlLink boss because he posted this: I hate that Dove commercial on TV. It's the one with the fat girl. I'm not exactly sure what she said exactly so please do correct me, but I think it's something like ang taba taba ko nga, ang pangit ko pa. What vales are they teaching our society that fat women virtually have zero chances of landing on a guy if they're ugly, too What a bunch of crap It's such a nice guy thing to say. in my head no, no, NOOOOOO say it ain't so in my ears It's Oh So Quiet by Bjork ,May, Look. Dominique...my punk rock baby niece. ,May, This urlLink story made my skin crawl when I first read it. Because it was caused by sheer kayabangan and another reason is because my sister could have easily been in that accident. A few days or maybe weeks after the incident, urlLink this was posted on the urlLink UP Diliman website. What appalls me is the las paragraph: Richard Ong's parents want to correct the rumors that they are an affluent family; that they have relatives in the police or military and that they intend to send their son abroad to escape responsibility. Both parents work in middle management of two local banks. The BMW is registered in the name of Atty. Ma. Leichelle Bonifacio, a cousin of Richard Ong. According to the mother, at the time of the incident the brother of the registered owner, Dick Kenneth Soriano, only let Richard Ong at the wheel. None of their children has their own cars. The cars driven by the parents are registered in the name of the banks under a car plan scheme. The mother had to raise money from relatives and buy off her car from the bank in order to sell it a day before Gwen Puyat and Meryl Antonio were discharged from St. Luke's so she could pay the cash required by the hospital. The hospital refused to give them a discount for the little less than P , . bill because of the rumor that General ang ama ng nakabanga. Am I supposed to be comforted by those facts That they weren't given a discount That they had to sell their cars That Richard Ong's family wasn't wealthy and was only from a middle class family Bullshit. Your son is a murderer. And what I find really disgusting is the fact that Mr. Ong's family will be able to bounce back from this, primarily because they have the means to. Resources will be available to them, and even if he serves the maximum jail time, he will be out in just six years . Precious' family will have to live not only without her presence, but also without the hope her UP education would have afforded for them.

I know I should be all out aaaaaawwwww on this because it should be endearing to see four generations of my family's women coming together, but, NO. I will not go awwwww. What I will say is: Shut up Ang ingay nyo They are so loud you would think that they were fire engines responding to a third alarm. It doesn't help any that my niece stays awake forever as long as there are voices and or sounds around her I'm blaming her dad, because he spoke to her all the time while she was in the womb.

I never dream about the people I'm crushing on. Exhibit A My dream about urlLink PatSu's Hunny went like this: I entered a crowded room and the only chair was the one next to him. I sit next to him and we proceed with the usual banter. I talk to him in Taglish and he seems to understand me all of this makes sense in my dream . We get so chummy that at one point I ask if I could look through his wallet. He says yes and proceed to take his billfold out. I look inside and see that there are literally hundreds of photos given to him by fans. HUNDREDS. I recognize some of the people in the photos because they were my classmates in high school. But that wasn't the weird bit. Even in my dream I found it kind of freaky that his wallet was.... urlLink Little Twin Stars . I woke up and shouted GET HIM OUT OF MY SUBCONSCIOUS Exhibit B My dream about urlLink Pauline's Baby was really boggling: I was finishing a paper report but realized that my PC printer was dead. I went to visit my friend in this really cool blue and silver and gray office and saw that he was there, too. When my friend and I were talking, he came up and said hello and asked what I was doing there. I said I needed to print my paper report blahblahblah. He said he wished he could help but his PC printer was being insane also, but said that he had one at his house and that we could go there and he'd finish my paper for me. I said yes I think my friend kind of faded into the background, but I was confident that it was ok and off we went to go to his place. Along the way, I realized that I was pregnant , and the shock of this makes me stop in my tracks in the middle of where we were supposed to wait for public transportation. He saves me from the traffic. Here's the creepy part. For some reason or another, in real life, Pauline's baby rubs me the wrong way get your mind out of the gutter .

It going to be a good show, I think. This guy is pretty cool. I have yet to hear a bad song done by him. The fact that he's eye candy has nothing to do with that pronouncement, I swear. I will resist going to this show with every fiber of my being, I swear to God If my urlLink boss gets to read this....can I go to the presscon again My best friend, Roxy, and I share urlLink a blog . You're welcome to read it if you want. I just won't be adding a permanent link to it here, because I'm not sure she wants me to do that. She's a better writer than I can ever hope to be. Plus she's brainy and funny and ecstatic over the fact that she gained weight which made her suddenly babe like. Anyway, we're both obsessed with urlLink Survivor well, actually I'm drooling over urlLink Ethan , and I suspect that she seriously wants to be friends with urlLink Brandon The African Queen that we kind of keep up with what they've done afterwards. Ethan joined urlLink Eco Challenge Fiji and Brandon dropped off the edge of the earth or moved to Castro, whichever . She Roxanna Banana then pointed me towards Eco Challenge because she knew I liked Ethan while she did the dance of joy over the fact that Hayden Chirstensen had a team that was competing as well. l r Hejsa Christensen, Hayden Christensen, Tove Christensen, Bill Trayling. Roxy's right, Tove looks like Michael Vartan. The family's a big bunch of sports nuts, but get this Hesja pulled them out for some reason. But hey, competing in Eco challenge prepared him for this side of the world and we're convinces that nothing can faze them anymore. Watch out, PI, Roxy's plotting something big.

Point your cursors urlLink here and read where it was taken from. Random college memory.

This must be something of a surprise. If, that is, this letter gets to you. I remembered your address, of course, but then it suddenly struck me that maybe you had moved and I didn't know and anyway the post round here isn't exactly reliable. So perhaps I am only writing a letter to myself. Really now that I've started I can't think what it was I wanted to say. I think it was just the act of writing that was important, just to feel as if I was still in contact with things, although I guess a blank piece of paper in an envelope would have seemed a little strange. I've really no need to ask how things are with you. It all seems to have worked out pretty much as you planned. But still I hope you are both healthy and happy.

The godess once said that the beauty of democracy is that everyone is entitled to his own opinion. No matter how moronic. True. And that the only way we would know if democracy actually works is if someone whose opinions are totally different from yours, is allowed to express them without fear of retribution. This is the PI, we have democracy coming out of our ears. We threw out presidents we didn't like because of democracy. It really wouldn't be too much of a stretch to claim that we are the most democratic country in the cosmos. I digress, back to my regularly scheduled spleen cleaning. But see, to put down other people; to tell them that they are inferior because of how they dress , or because they enjoy mainstream, bubblegum my, mushy, and evidently, not your type music is just sad. Making it sound like it's wrong to flow with the middle while revelling in your freakishness is not very democratic it's bigotry. Starting something with a disclaimer I'm not putting you down, ha But.... does nothing for people's egos. It's fecking shallow. I reserve my choicest invectives for you...

Last night's old movie was To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar . No matter how many times I watch it, I still get a kick out of seeing Blade aka Wesley Snipes in drag. So anyway, in that movie I saw the gwapo licious Michael Vartan staright to video Vartan, he calls himself don't you just love a guy who has a sense of humor , playing a redneck named Tommy. He was the one who was wo manhandled by Noxema Jackson aka Jesse's daughter, aka Blade, aka Wesley Snipes . You should go see it. Watch out for him at the end during the Strawberry Social he's wearing a red brocade jacket and his hair is all slicked back. I also saw Blythe Danner Gwynnie's mommy . But does she count Methinks not. But the highlight of that movie is still Miss ChiChi Rodriguez , played wonderfully by John Leguizamo.

At one of those times, I think I may have actually looked like I was trying out for the Icecapades. I did a sort of triple lutz, then an awkward arabesque and finished it off with a modified split. And I tripped over my own feet twice when I was already inside ELJ the building where I work : once going inside the elevators, another while sliding my butt into my seat. That has got to be a record; I'm not usually so ungainly. I actually have perfect coordination and hardly ever bump into things that are clearly in my way. I wonder what is it with today that I'm so klutzy. Lutz na may K Klutz. Klutz me. Oh and may I add that a classy education does not produce an equivalently classy individual.

But the seats are limited in total and it's first come first serve. I asked an officemate if he would be so kind as to go to the th floor tomorrow and ask if there are still passes available.

Especially if you go to a private, catholic girls' school. Because after you're in and they name you after a fruit, and your attitude changes to that of a spitting cobra with PMS, when you die people's reactions to your death will range from: She was not a nice person , to: She was an evil bitch. She deserved to die. And all your mother's public pronouncements that you were a sweet, gentle, affectionate person will have people wanting to tar and feather her. This is Pia Garcia. Just thinking aloud. in my ears Once In A Lifetime Craig David ,August, Saddest Poem by Pablo Neruda I can write the saddest poem of all tonight. Write, for instance: The night is full of stars, and the stars, blue, shiver in the distance. The night wind whirls in the sky and sings. I can write the saddest poem of all tonight. I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too. On nights like this, I held her in my arms. I kissed her so many times under the infinite sky. She loved me, sometimes I loved her. How could I not have loved her large, still eyes I can write the saddest poem of all tonight. To think I don't have her. To feel that I've lost her. To hear the immense night, more immense without her. And the poem falls to the soul as dew to grass. What does it matter that my love couldn't keep her. The night is full of stars and she is not with me. That's all. Far away, someone sings. Far away. My soul is lost without her. As if to bring her near, my eyes search for her. My heart searches for her and she is not with me. The same night that whitens the same trees. We, we who were, we are the same no longer. I no longer love her, true, but how much I loved her. My voice searched the wind to touch her ear. Someone else's. She will be someone else's. As she once belonged to my kisses. Her voice, her light body. Her infinite eyes. I no longer love her, true, but perhaps I love her. Love is so short and oblivion so long. Because on nights like this I held her in my arms, my soul is lost without her. Although this may be the last pain she causes me, and this may be the last poem I write for her. ,August, It's inhuman to make people who aren't in the industry of agriculture wake up early on a NATIONAL HOLIDAY and have them go to work. in my ears Ramones tribute on the channel ,August, Note to self: For next week's show, call mandaluyong and tell them to turn on the template at EXACTLY pm, whether we're on the air or not. in my ears UAAP replay on my channel ,August, Who Will You Marry by Sari Name Date April , Spouse Clay Aiken Price of Wedding , Created with urlLink quill 's urlLink MemeGen Who Pia is a Giant Moth that can Generate Electricity and Fly, is Very Slow, and eats Metal.

For that kind of money he'd better be singing to ME alone. Considering the fact that he isn't really that popular here, I shudder to think about how much tickets to my Josh Groban's concert will cost. Oh well, I'll be sure to go to the press conference anyway, so I guess I'll have him sign my CD there. I am making a conscious effort to be a fan of someone.

I remember my mom once asked me what I wanted when I turned eighteen and I looked up at her and answered: a library. She smiled at me and from that day on, I got new books every week. I also got a huge box of books from my grandfather right before he died. I didn't know much about my mom's dad, because he and my grandmother separated even before my mom met sperm donor. I don't recall ever really talking to him or receiving gifts or letters either, but I figured that he must be a good sort to send me books. One of the books included in the package was a paperback called Hey, Didi Darling , it was written by S.A. Kennedy and was published around . I loved that book to death. Even after The Uses of Enchantment , Color is the Suffering of Light and She's Come Undone , I go back to that book and realize that it still speaks to me as clearly now as it did all those years ago. in my ears Crazy Britney Spears ,August, urlLink JecK sent this to my e mail. The moon and Mars in my ears the Indigo Girls on my channel ,August, It's been a pretty tense few days for me here at work. Nobody's breathing down my neck or anything like that, it's because I'm included in the team that produces a live cable talk show about the urlLink UAAP . It's a group effort and the people I'm with are very capable and very knowledgable about how to put together these kinds of shows. But see, I know nothing about it. Nada. Nothing. Zero. Zilch. Wala. There was a meeting at the beginning of this week, and I basically sat there with big eyes and a slack jaw. I took notes, but at that time, nothing was sinking in. Everyone was calm, and confident. I needed to jumpstart my brain after a few minutes. Also, since urlLink Jovan is on leave wish him well, guys. He deserves it , he also put me in charge of a few things which I never thought I would be doing. Again, nothing heavy, but enough to put an inexperienced doof like me through loops trying to get everything in order. He's been extremely supportive and kept telling me to be calm. Don't be tense. Enjoy the entire experience. I don't know about you, but I get uneasy when someone tells me things like that. But then, I got an IM from urlLink Anna , a few minutes ago and she asked how many hours I spend in the office. I told her that I worked around hours a day, more or less. She said that it was a pretty fair time, but then told me that I should be careful as work is addictive around these parts . I had to smile at the last bit, because I knew what she meant. She also sent me an e mail about trying to establish a healthy balance between work and your life: ... encourage people to put some balance in their lives. For instance, here is a guideline I find helpful: Wake up, eat a good breakfast, and go to work. Work hard and smart for eight or nine hours. Go home. Read the books comics, watch a funny movie, dig in the dirt, play with your kids, etc. Eat well and sleep well. ...Love your job, but don't fall in love with the company.

And now I'm serving time for mistakes made by another in a another lifetime. How long till my soul gets it right Can any human being ever reach that kind of light I call on the resting soul of Galileo King of night vision, king of insight. And then I think about my fear of motion, which I never could explain. Some other fool across the ocean years ago must have crashed his little airplane. How long till my soul gets it right Could any human being ever reach that kind of light I call on the resting soul of Galileo King of night vision, king of insight.

And you wonder why she's my goddess. Copy This by Jessica Zafra Does anyone else find it funny that people who make much more money than we do are appealing to us not to deprive them of their income You have the nerve to charge me P for a CD that is being sold on the street for P and you expect my sympathy The campaign against pirated software, CD's, VCD's, audio and cassettes, would have us believe that piracy is our problem. Really How is shelling out P for a disc that contains P , worth of software a problem for me It would seem that the pirates are doing me, and my shrinking wallet a big favor. Why should it bother me that a movie which has not yet opened in Metro Manila theatres is being peddled on VCD on Ayala Avenue for P I have no fights with the pirates. They are selling me information I might otherwise not have access to because of prohibitive costs. Yes they are thieves and thieves should be punished, but they are not stealing from me. Oh sure, you can lecture me about in the long run I will pay for buying bootleg but by then I will have used the information for my benefit . So let me make a correction. Piracy is the problem of the manufacturers, the software houses, record companies, and motion picture companies, whom I shall refer to from hereon as the corporations. By telling us not to buy pirated materials for the good of everyone , corporations make it appear that corporate interests and the public interest are the same thing. This is unlaughably untrue. Corporations makes noise about working in the public interest but these noises are called public relations, PR. But their duty is to their owners. The anti piracy ads, which appeals to my virtue, pass the responsibility of combating piracy to me. HELLO. They invoke the law and call on my conscience to protect their profit margin, but when I shell out P for a CD that turns out to be crap, I can't invoke the law, and corporations have no conscience. We may all be equal under the law, but they have the best lawyers. I guess their complaints are valid because they stand to lose more money, while I'm just a sucker who bought the promotional hype. The anti piracy campaign says that when we buy unauthorized copies a.k.a. bootleg we are stealing from the creators of the music, movies or computer programs. This would be the case if the proceeds of the sales went to artist themselves. We know that the artists get a small royalty; most of the money goes to the corporations. They profit from the work of the artists dry. Their excuses is for a small royalty, they can suck the artists dry. Their excuse is that they spent vast sums of money on the marketing of the artists' work. In short, the season originals cost so much is because the huge marketing expenses are passed on to us. Why should we finance the ridiculous costs of hype When you buy bootleg, you deny the artist a couple of bucks but you stick it to the corporation, which is so rich it won't even say ouch. I find it hard to summon up any sympathy for a multi million dollar entity that does business in countries. Awww, the poor corporations, their executives won't be buying personal Lear jets this quarter. Buying bootleg has a Robin Hood appeal; Rob the rich to give the poor, meaning you. It's the opposite of jueteng, in which robs the poor in order to give to the rich. The corporations are laying a massive guilt trip on consumers when they should be working to make their products less easy to steal. With the technology we have, it is extremely to make high quality copies of anything. In the past we worried that the bootleg goods could damage our electronic equipment; today's fake CD's are almost exactly like the originals. While the corporations are piracy proofing their wares, maybe they should cut us a break and drop their prices. The pirates have shown that it is possible to make CD's cheaper. Take the hint, and spare us the sob stories about high marketing costs and your dwindling profits. I don't buy pirated software not just because pirates don't usually do Mac programs but because I love my Mac. But I cannot tell PC users not to buy bootleg software when it costs one fiftieth the price of the original. Caveat emptor, naturally, and the fake software may cause their PCs to crash but PCs do that anyway. Hey doesn't the idea of killing Bill Gates of . add more zeroes of his income appeal to you Look at him, the guy's rolling in money, but he won't spend for a proper haircut. Besides, If you really want to quibble over it, didn't Bill Gates and Steve Jobs borrow information from the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center Cut the crap, and stop appealing in my good nature. It is not my job to protect your interests. The pirates are sleazy, but they have inadvertently raised the possibility of a future in which the artists reaches her audience directly, without a corporate middleman. Think of a future in which you profit from your ideas. Not bloody likely right but it's a good thought. Tanginaaaaaaa. May babaeng talipandas na nilalandi ang CB ko.

It'll be up soon : From urlLink Jonathan Canier's Zodiac Forecasts : Patricia Garcia doesn't know the meaning of the word 'enough.' It's not that Patricia is greedy or that she lacks self discipline far from it. Patricia goes out of her way to share, care and be fair. That's why she never quite knows when to stop. To draw the line you have to be a little insensitive. How, precisely, should it be measured With a magnifying glass Or with a microscope Patricia Garcia is extremely sensitive and keenly perceptive. She is a Libran, born under the sign of the scale. Patricia knows in her heart that no matter how meticulously you ever weigh anything in this world you can always reach a different conclusion if you apply a more refined set of measurements. Patricia knows that those refinements are infinite. Hours have minutes, minutes have seconds. Seconds have nanoseconds. No wonder Patricia Garcia is never sure what time it is Some people are prone to assume that Patricia has her head in the clouds. They think that she lives in a world of her own full of lofty ideas and complex theories. Other people have the temerity to watch Patricia at work in this way and to suppose that Patricia is indecisive Where on earth do they get that idea from Actually Patricia is one of the most decisive people on the face of the planet. she absolutely, definitely knows what she wants but she only knows it from one second to the next. To the untrained eye this appears to be an inconsistency. What they fail to see are the countless nanoseconds during which Patricia's sense of purpose is solid as a rock. Patricia, though, knows what people are thinking and so, to keep them on their toes she makes a point of declaring her intentions loudly and clearly. she makes quite sure that these brave statements never differ from day to day.

If there's another thing I've learned, it's never to settle for anything less than what I need.

They don't believe in the existence and sheer possibilities of their own desires. Like me, they're probably afraid to...But what does prepare a person for love and desire, pain and loss Each of un runs from even the things we want, primarily because we are afraid to claim them as ours, of consequently being incapable of keeping them, and of realizing that we are inadequate for their needs and wants.

And the funny thing is, I can't bring myself to talk about it because everyone without exception will be thinking: What You're still mooning over . That's said with either a very condescending tone or a snicker. The snickering I can take, because it is hilarious most disasters are ; it's the condescension that's insulting.

Turns out she got heatstroke, fainted on her bike, fell, lost consciousness for a few seconds and woke up with her right side covered in bruises and scrapes.

Just so the next time I see your name I can say: Ah, there's so and so...they're obsessed with so and so. I'd love it if every single person who friended me would do this.

OK, so we're still not close. I haven't spoken with him for over years. I get news of how he is from his mom and from his brothers, but from him pffft. So why, then, should I be bothered about the news that he has an almost year old child That I have almost one year old nieces I feel like this invalidates me further than I already am. P.S.

Important Warning for Men Police are warning all men who frequent clubs, parties and local pubs to be alert and stay cautious when offered a drink from any woman. A date rape drug on the market called Beer is used by many females to target unsuspecting men. The drug is generally found in liquid form and is now available almost anywhere. It comes in bottles, cans, from taps and in large kegs. Beer is used by female sexual predators at parties and bars to persuade their male victims to go home and have sex with them. Typically, a woman needs only to persuade a guy to consume a few units of Beer and then simply ask him home for no strings attached sex. Men are rendered helpless against this approach. After several Beers, men will often succumb to desires to perform sexual acts on horrific looking women to whom they would never normally be attracted. After drinking Beer men often awaken with only hazy memories of exactly what happened to them the night before, often with just a vague feeling that: something bad occurred. At other times these unfortunate men are swindled out of their life's savings, in a familiar scam known as a relationship. It has been reported that in extreme cases, the female may even be Shrewd enough to entrap the unsuspecting male into a longer term form of servitude and punishment referred to as marriage. Apparently, men are much more susceptible to this scam after Beer is administered and sex is offered by the predatory females. Please Forward this warning to every male you know. If you fall victim to this insidious Beer and the predatory women administering it, there are male support groups with venues in every town where you can discuss the details of your shocking encounter in an open and frank manner with similarly affected, like minded guys. For the support group nearest you, just look up Golf Courses in the yellow pages. ,March, The primary religion in this office is FOOSBALL. ,March, Ngayon naniniwala na ako. urlLink Marami ngang bobo sa bansang 'yun.

In my whole entire life I dun believe if der's any B cH in dis world.. but I guess she's da first one dat I know.. the first one dat I can catogorized as dat creature.. but my ex dun like me to say dat about her.. and so, I dun say it.. not b'coz of her.. but b'coz if I do say it, it means dat my ex dun haf any dignity cuz he go out wif a B cH... It's weird u know... I supposed to hate my ex.. but I couldn't.. I dunno how long dis thing gonna go on.. He's far away from me.. I dunno what he's doing.. but I trust him.. 'n I do believe in him wif all of my heart.. If I only can b his frenz I dun regret it.. I dun think my ex know dis site.. and so, I dun think he knows wat I'm thinkin' bout dis.. I promised him not to talk about dis thing anymore wif him.. All dis long I've been waiting for him.. it's been like half a year or so.. but I guess I can't wait all the time.. besides, when I told him dat I was waiting for him all dis long, he reply me bak asking, Did I ask u to wait And ofcoz the answer is no.. I dunno.. I'm confused... sumtimes he's kind to me.. but sumtimes he seems soo mean to me.. it's juz weird.. I know dat all dis long I've been lying to myself saying dat I dun luv him anymore.. but wat can I say I really do believe in wat I said dat is, I dun luv him anymore.. until the day when Jessie, one of my fren was like yelling at me.. telling me to stop lying to myself.. I wasn't aware dat what she said was so true dat time.. and so, I yelled at her bak.. we were like nearly having a big war afta schl dat time.. but den both of us were quiet till I said to her dat I'm sorry.. asking her to explain it to me again.. It took me pretty long time to realised dat wat she said is true.. Anyway, to cut the long story short, me 'n her be frenz again.. I told my ex dat I still luvs him.. he got freaked out 'n confused cuz all dis long I've been telling him dat I dun luv him.. and sooo.. yeah.. he said to me dat he dunno.. and the story goes on.. he can't say or do anything about it.. so, both of us.. knowing dat we luv each other haf to be quiet till the rite time cums by... What should I do then Even if I keep on covering myself by saying, I'm ok wif their relationship, is dat mean I'm lying to myself again cuz honestly I dun.. I dun like her to be around my ex.. I dun like her.. I can't trust her.. she betrayed me.. Juz becoz she's in da same city as my ex 'n I'm not, she can betrayed me like dat.. gosh.. The only answer dat I'm waiting for dis time is whether my ex really luvs me still or not.. dat's the only thing dat I want to know.. But I guess by the end of this year if I can't find the answer, I'll take it as he doesn't luv me anymore.. and he only considered me as his fren.. and afta dat time, I might go out wif sum else.. but who knows I'm not the kind of gal who can fall in luv easily.. buy let's juz see... I luv my ex so much.. I can't keep him off my head.. he always in my mind and in my heart.. I luv him.. I miss him.. but once again.. I wonder whether he still loves me or not.. wonder whether we could get bak together or not.. If the worst cums to worst dat we can't be together again, I'll move on.. I'll look for sum dat luvs me in return.. Did I make the right choice I dunno.. let's juz see wat's ahead of me dis time.. Love, vcToRia

 ,juillet, How could I forget this... The th Commandment that never made the Old Testament... . Thou shalt not not love The Pettit Project Head over to Pettit's website http: thepettitproject.com bless ,juillet, prounced: pett it Alright, I know it's been awhile, but meh. July th, I went to a Fefe Dobson concert. If you don't know who Miss Dobson is, then you are a bigger loser than me... http: www.fefedobson.com. Btw, Fefe is not her real name, but a pet name coming from the proper Felicity . Anyhow, I would not have gone to that concert if it wasn't for Julie K. who is my next door neighbour. She's a really nice person. Her eldest son, Dan, is Fefe's lead guitarist. So we went downtown to Capital Music Hall. It was a tiny little place, well tiny compared to like the NAC lol. It was about the size of a gymnasium. Okay so I was there, standing for like minutes when the opening band The Pettit Project started. The lead singer dude, Scott Komer, is like ' , blonde and really, really queery. There's nothing wrong with queery people though. They played like all of their songs, about , I think. When they were done, I was happy that the night was almost through you see, I didn't particularly LOVE them at that time , I was more worried if I was ever going to hear again. The loudness of the music was well... extreme. Next, Fefe came on and did all her schblewy that's a brand new word I just came up with w t She was pretty awsome. She had one song, which she said was new, Don't Go, Boys and Girls . It seemed to be about boys should be with boys, girls should be with girls, and boys should be with girls , I think. I never really understood that one. I mean what does the title have to do with such a topic Don't Go Afterwards, my mind sort of drifted like it does often and I started thinking about Pettit. I really wanted to get a CD. So I did. I made Scotty sign it. Yay Anyway, they are all I can listen to now. I think I know all the words to the songs on that CD, as well as Mr. Obvious on http: purevolume.com thepettitproject music. These people absolutely rock my world. What is so amazing about Pettit, is that I was never really in love with rock music. Now I am. I have pretty much begun ditching rap, except d and eminem I haven't listened to much country or celtic or welsh or french or anything but Pettit, since I discovered them. So we can now say that July th, ce was a life changing day for moi. Tr s bien. bless ye
